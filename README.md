# VueExamples
Random components and pages I made in Vue / Vuetify / Nuxt

Many of these would need other dependencies and such
in order to be run

### Surveys

The /survey folder includes many components that I wrote over the months. 

These pages and components make different API requests to retrieve and update data related to surveys.

As it is, you cannot view these without running a full nuxt / vue / vuetify setup, along with a backend to serve that data.

Mock data should be created to visualize these items.

I will probably make a separate commit for showing limited functionality
